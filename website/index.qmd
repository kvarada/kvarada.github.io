I am Varada Kolhatkar (\[ʋəɾəda kɔːlɦəʈkər\]). I am an educator in computer science, specializing in applied machine learning and
data science. My overarching goal is to improve education in these fields by making them more accessible and less intimidating.

My background is in computer science and I received my Ph.D. in computational linguistics from the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/).
My heart is in teaching and learning and in the 2018-19 academic year, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to teach for [the Master of Data Science program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/) at [the University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). Since then, I’ve been teaching courses in applied machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing in the Department of Computer Science and the Master of Data Science program . My current roles are Assistant Professor of Teaching and Co-Director of the Master of Data Science Vancouver program. In simple terms, I strive to help students learn computer science and data science, while also working to ensure the smooth operation of our Master of Data Science program.

In the past, I have spent time as a researcher in industry as well as in academia in different cities around the world, including Duluth, Baltimore, Toronto, Ottawa, Stuttgart, and Hamburg.

If you are curious, Varada (वरदा) is a Sanskrit name, which means the one who grants your wishes! I grew up in a traditional household in a city called [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune) in India. My first language is [Marathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language).
