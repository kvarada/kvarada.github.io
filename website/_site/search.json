    "text": "Welcome to my webpage! I am Varada Kolhatkar (IPA: [ ã…ô…æ…ôda k…îÀêl…¶…ô àk…ôr]). (If you are curious, Varada (‡§µ‡§∞‡§¶‡§æ) is a Sanskrit name, which means the one who grants your wishes :innocent:!) I grew up in a traditional household in a city called Pune in India. My first language is Marathi.\nMy background is in computer science and I received my Ph.D.¬†in computational linguistics from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.\nMy heart is in teaching and learning and in the 2018-19 academic year, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to teach for the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. Since then, I‚Äôve been teaching courses in applied machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing in the Department of Computer Science and the Master of Data Science program . My current roles are Assistant Professor of Teaching and Co-Director of the Master of Data Science Vancouver program. In simple terms, I strive to help students learn computer science and data science, while also working to ensure the smooth operation of our Master of Data Science program.\nIn the past, I have spent time as a researcher in industry as well as in academia in different cities around the world, including Duluth, Baltimore, Toronto, Ottawa, Stuttgart, and Hamburg."

In particular, I am interested in teaching topics in these areas to students with diverse backgrounds so that they can apply them in their own disciplines. To effectively serve this target audience, one of my goals has been making complex concepts more approachable and less intimidating without losing their depth or rigour.\nCheck out my @appliedmachinelearningubc YouTube channel, where I share introductory videos on applied machine learning."

To achieve this, I focus on two core areas: facilitating meaningful learning experiences and community and student well-being.\nOver the years, I have developed a structured five-stage process for students to effectively navigate the complex network of ideas inherent in the fields of data science and machine learning: ENGAGE with motivation and curiosity; GRASP concepts from various perspectives; PRACTICE to internalize the concepts; APPLY to use these concepts in new contexts; and ADAPT to adjust to evolving challenges. I support each of these stages with techniques from evidence-based teaching and learning literature."
